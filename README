		IO::Capture

  The IO::Capture Module defines an abstract base class that can be
used to create any number of useful sub-classes that capture output 
being sent on a filehandle such as STDOUT or STDERR.
  Several modules come with the distribution that define sub-
classes of IO::Capture to do just that. (I.e., capture STDOUT and STDERR)  
See the man page IO::Capture::Overview for a discussion of these 
modules and how to build a module to sub-class the B<IO::Capture> 
class yourself. 
  To build and install this module, follow the standard procedures:

    $ perl Makefile.PL
    $ make
    $ make test
    $ su
    # make install

CHANGES:
        I found a couple of problems that made me re-think the module
        IO::Capture::ErrorMessages.  As a result, I am  removing this
        module from the distribution.  It is  now depreciated and will
        be remove in the next release.   IO::Capture::Stderr now has
        has the same functionality that IO::Capture::Stderr did previously,
        and can be used instead.

	I have added a new parameter to IO::Capture::Stderr, "FORCE_CAPTURE_WARN".
	It controls capturing text sent via warn(), if $SIG{__WARN__} has been 
	changed.  The default is to let the text go to the handler set in 
	$SIG{__WARN__}.  If you want to override this, set FORCE_CAPTURE_WARN
        to a 1.
